  //   title: 'Why am I seeing Tundra Wolves when I search for Tundra?',
  //   body: '  When you search for "Tundra" the app displays the results that each site gives for that term - some of those
  //   might be Tundra Wolves. The app isn't smart enough to know that the extra word means this is a different card.
  //   "Why not just filter out anything that isn't an exact match?", you might ask. It's a good idea, but
  //   unfortunately it would exclude a lot of valid results.
  //   <br/>
  //   Consider these examples of item names a site might use: "Damnation", "Damnation Foil", "Damnation Judge Promo",
  //   "Damnation Player Rewards", "Damnation (JPN)" and so on. In order to know that "Damnation - Secret Lair" is a
  //   valid result but that "Choice of Damnations" isn't, the app would need to have an exhaustive "allow list"
  //   of terms to ignore when trying to filter results. Inevitably something would get missed off the list, and valid
  //   results would not be shown. On balance I think it's better to include a few irrelevant results than to exclude
  //   relevant ones.
  //   <br />
  //   I would like to try and fix this - it's the most common piece of feedback I get from people who've used the
  //   app - but finding an effective solution is proving very difficult, so we're stuck seeing Tundra Wolves for now.',

  //   title: 'Can you filter / sort the results in such and such a way ?',
  //   body: 'Ehh... probably not? The app does have options to help control this, but a huge part of the equation is that
  //   each seller's site is very different and it's not practical to pass on this kind of information. What the app
  //   does is make a very basic request, usually by passing on the exact string you type and nothing else, and then
  //   try to manipulate the returned results.',
